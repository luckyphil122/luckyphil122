headline_emphasis: public good
headline_tail: ". The software for it should be too."
intro_long: >-
  I build open-source regulatory tools for the financial industry —
  quietly, after the day job. The premise is simple: banks that hold the
  right capital and run the back-office cheaply can offer the public
  better products. The maths is well-defined; the software shouldn't be a
  moat.
intro_coda: >-
  A parallel practice, kept honest by being open, and kept warm by being
  shared.

# // Now strip
now:
  - Working through PRA PS1/26 mapping for the SA module.
  - "Reading: Bank of England SS9/17, on internal model governance."
  - "Listening: shipping forecasts, mostly."

# Beliefs (4 columns, § 01 – § 04)
beliefs:
  - n: "01"
    head: Capital adequacy is a public good.
    body: >-
      Risk-Weighted Assets, IRB, the Standardised Approach — these define
      how safely a bank operates and how much it costs to hold a
      customer's mortgage. The arithmetic should be transparent and the
      implementations should be free.
  - n: "02"
    head: Cheap back-office, cheap products.
    body: >-
      Every line item that a bank pays a vendor for compliance computation
      is a line item the customer eventually pays. Open-source the
      computation, push the cost curve down, the saving lands somewhere
      real.
  - n: "03"
    head: Sustainable software, sustainable teams.
    body: >-
      Agile is not a ceremony — it's a way to ship for years without
      burning out. Small batches, honest tests, and code people are proud
      to maintain at 11pm on a Tuesday.
  - n: "04"
    head: Regulators are users, not adversaries.
    body: >-
      PRA, BCBS, EBA — these documents are an interface. Treat them like
      an API spec, write tests against them, and the rest follows.
